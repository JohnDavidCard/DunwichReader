<p align="left">Hello, and welcome.   </p>

<p align="left">This modest website is intended to be an ever-growing repository of classic fiction. With a particular focus on works from the 'Golden Age' of speculative-fiction, and earlier. We here at DunwichReader.com hope to keep the site up, and expanding, as long as possible in the hope that we might make as many pieces of classic fiction readily available to as many people as we can.      </p>

<p align="left">These stories are typically considered some of the best, or most important and seminal works in the genre. But, despite this, and despite these works being customarily in the public domain, it's surprisingly difficult to find complete and original copies of many classic pieces of literature released between the late-Nineteenth and mid-Twenieth Centuries. Especially not for free, or if any given work's original publisher has since gone defunct - as is, unfortunately, often the case.          </p>

<p align="left">Below is a selection of authors we've already begun compiling works from. On each author's page, you'll find some brief background about them, as well as individually-prepared copies of all their significant works - which are all currently available to view or download as .pdf files. We hope that eventually this website will be able to provide copies of all notable works within our focal period - but, until that day we hope you enjoy what we've already prepared, and that you make sure to check back here regularly for more.    </p>
